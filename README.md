# Simple Calculator Using Flutter

This project demonstrates how to create a simple calculator in Flutter using various widgets and packages to build the user interface and handle interactions.

## Key Widgets Used

### TextButton
- `TextButton` is used to create clickable buttons for the calculator's digits and operations.
- It provides a simple way to handle user interactions with various styles.

### FittedBox
- `FittedBox` is used to fit its child within itself, which is useful for scaling text and ensuring it fits within the given space.
- This is particularly helpful for displaying the calculator's result in a responsive manner.

### Padding
- `Padding` is used to add space around the widgets to improve the overall layout and aesthetics.
- It ensures that the buttons and display are not cluttered and are easy to interact with.

### Align
- `Align` is used to align child widgets within a parent widget.
- In a calculator, it can be used to align the display text to the right for a more conventional look.

## Using Packages

Flutter's rich ecosystem provides a multitude of packages that can enhance your app. For a simple calculator, you might not need many external packages, but here are a few that could be useful:

- **provider**: For state management.
- **intl**: For formatting numbers and currencies.
- **flutter_screenutil**: For responsive UI design across different screen sizes.
